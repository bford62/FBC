      <p>
        Our men's ministry provides events and small group opportunities
        intended to help men grow spiritually and to develop relationship with
        other guys. More and deeper relationships will lead to more and better
        ministry!
      </p>
      <p>
        We have men's Bible studies on Sunday morning during Connections,
        Wednesday night at the church, and on Wednesday mornings at 6am at
        Larry's diner in Plainfield.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also have several fellowships throughout the year including: golf,
        fishing, paintball, bowling, and cards/billiards. And because we invest
        in the next generation, we often invite high school (and sometimes
        middle school) guys to join us. Come on out and get involved!

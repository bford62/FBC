      <h2>Children's Ministy</h2>
      <p>
        We love kids! One of our biggest events is our Vacation Bible School.
        One week each summer our church is transformed and over 100 children
        participate in games, music, teaching, and, of course, snacks!
      </p>
      <p>
        Each Sunday we offer age-appropriate teaching for kids through 5th
        grade. Additionally, for the little ones we offer care during worship
        service.
      </p>
      <p>We hope to be a trusted partner as you lead your kids spiritually.</p>

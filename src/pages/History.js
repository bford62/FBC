      <h2>Friendship Baptist Church History</h2>
      <p>
        From 1957-1959, a group of believers met regularly in Plainfield for
        prayer and fellowship. In 1959, Calvary Baptist Church in Aurora, IL
        sponsored a mission in Plainfield. The first worship service was in
        October of that year with 13 members present. In November 1960,
        Plainfield Missionary Baptist Church was constituted with 41 members and
        met on Mill Street.

        In 1967, the church purchased three acres of land at Rt. 59 and Norman
        Avenue (current location) and a new building was constructed. Later that
        year, the church changed its name to First Southern Baptist Church of
        Plainfield. The first services were held in the new building in February
        1968. An educational wing was later built in 1978.

        In 1989, Dr. Michael Nolen was called as pastor and served until October
        2002. The church also changed its name to Friendship Baptist Church.
        Rick Mullan was brought on staff as Minister of Education in December
        1998. He served in this role, as well as Worship Leader, until his
        unexpected death in March 2017. In September 2004, the church called Dr.
        Odis Weaver as Senior Pastor and he served until his retirement in
        October 2021. In 2007, Pastor Doug Anderson was added to the church
        staff as our Student Ministry Pastor and still serves in this role.

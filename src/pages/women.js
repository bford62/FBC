      <h2>Women's Ministry</h2>
      <p>
        Women of Worth (WOW) is our ladies ministry providing times for women to
        fellowship and study God's Word together. Some of our activities are
        Bible studies, girls' night out, a quilting class, our annual ornament
        exchange, conferences and retreats. All women are welcome and encouraged
        to connect with us to build life long friendships and strengthen your
        walk with God.

        “Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all.” Charm is
        deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the Lord is to
        be praised.” <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+31%3A29-30&version=NIV">Proverbs 31:29-30</a>

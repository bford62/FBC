      <p>
        The Village of Plainfield is an awesome place to live. So many great
        things happen here and we love to be involved!
      </p>
      <p>
        We serve and support a number of community efforts to make the world a
        better place. Here are just a few of the ways we get involved:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Plainfield Food Pantry</li>
        <li>Green Harvest Food Pantry</li>
        <li>Living Alternatives Pregnancy Resource Center</li>
        <li>Plainfield Fest</li>
        <li>Viewing the Plainfield Fireworks from our property</li>
        <li>
          We are always on the lookout for more ways our church can serve the
          people of the Plainfield area! Bring your ideas and join as we seek to
          Light Our World!
        </li>
        <li>
          We also look beyond Plainfield to the whole world. We participate in
          mission trips (for example we have sent teams to several states,
          Africa, and Bulgaria! We also find ways to help other areas of the
          world through organizations such as Feed My Starving Children.
        </li>

          Wild Game Dinner: The purpose of Chosen Arrow Ministry is to build
          relationships with fellow outdoorsmen in the Joliet/Plainfield area.
          We offer "How To" workshops, 3D, Fun, and Family Bow Shoots, a
          fantastic Wild Game Dinner, and education in hunting and safety. We
          also introduce hunters to Christ as we honor God's creation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Our Wild Game Dinners have been a huge success. Hope to see you next
          year!
